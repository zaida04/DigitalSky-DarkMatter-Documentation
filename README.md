## About

Sky-Skan doesn't provide a clear cut documentation for functions and properties regarding _Button Scripts_. This repository aims to solve that, by allowing the community to work together to compile their own documentation.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. We will use [gitbooks](https://www.gitbook.com/) on documenting and guiding. You can make contributions from either gitbooks, or github as you please.
