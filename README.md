## Documentation
At this point we have all our docs on github. This is subject to change in the future.

## About
Sky-Skan doesn't provide a clear cut documentation for functions and properties regarding *Button Scripts*. This repository aims to solve that, by allowing the community to work together to compile their own documentation.

## Contributing
