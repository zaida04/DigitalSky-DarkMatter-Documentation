Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. We will use [gitbooks](https://www.gitbook.com/) on documenting and guiding. You can make contributions from either gitbooks, or GitHub as you please.
