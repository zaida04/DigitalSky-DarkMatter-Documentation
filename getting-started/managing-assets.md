# Managing Assets

## Getting to the Asset Manager

You can find the Asset Manager if it's not already open by going to the top bar,`Windows > Asset Manager` . You'll see a window that looks like this: 

![The Asset Manager](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

We're going to quickly dissect this window so you know what each button does. The collection of folders on the left hand side are your folder of Assets \(`A6`\). There should be some that come with your copy of Dark Matter. You can create another one by clicking the the folder with a plus button in it \(`A1`\). Go ahead and give it a name and hit `OK`. You can now create assets in the folder by finding the folder in the folder list \(`A6`\) and clicking on it. You'll notice when you click on the folder once, `A6` doesn't change. But if you double click on it, `A6` turns into an "open folder" icon.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the folder doesn't have the open icon, ASSETS CHANGED WILL NOT SAVE. 
{% endhint %}

Now, onto creating the asset itself. If you see where `A5` is on the image above, that's where the different _types_ of assets are. The main types are slide and text for our purposes. 

![Slide and Text \(left and right\)](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

Let's start with the **slide** asset type. If you go ahead and click on it, you'll be prompted to give your new asset a name. **Note: You must have a folder selected to create an asset. The asset needs somewhere to go.** Once you go ahead and hit OK you'll notice that we have a new entry in the list under our various asset manager buttons. If you go ahead and click on it, you now have access to your very own asset. We will go over the various customization options for assets later. If you want to load an asset into a button, just click on the asset entry in the list that we talked about before, and drag it over to your button ScriptPad. This will make a line similar to: `Assets FolderName.Load(AssetName)` . You now have the button in your script ready to be used.
