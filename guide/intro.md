## Introduction to the introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Digital Sky Dark Matter. For reference docs, `Object#method` if there is a `#`, you can assume whatever after it is a method. For `Object.property` you can assume what comes after the `.` is a property. There might potentially be chaining such as `Object.property#method` where .property might return another Object \(ref: OOP programming\).
